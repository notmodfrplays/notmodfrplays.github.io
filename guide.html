<h2> Finding a location </h2>
<p> If you are like me, and live in the San Francisco Bay Area, there are multiple places to play DDR that have e-amusement support. Some good examples could be Round1 which is a Japanese arcade chain or Dave and Busters. 
    Smaller arcades or GolfLand also have DDR, and other rhythm games.
</p>

<h2> What the hell is e-amusement? </h2>
<p> e-amusement is an online service which allows you to keep scores and stats on the internet. All you need is a small initial payment for the card and that is it. (Round1 carry e-amusement cards, this is where I bought mine) </p>
<p> An e-amusement card allows special features, which are exclusive to online cabinets only. Examples of these are premium play, saved stats, rivals, entry into tournaments, exclusive songs, and GALAXY play on DDR. </p>
<p> Pretty inticing amirite? That was when I caved in to get an e-amusement card</p>
<h2> How to set up e-amusement</h2>
<ul> 
<li> 1. Purchase e-amusement card from vendor. (Could be from online or from Round1)</li>
<li>2. Go to any e-amusement supported BEMANI game, like DDR, IIDX, DanceRushStardom or Pop'n Music </li>
<li> 3. Scan or insert card in desiginated location on machines with the e-amusement logo. Follow instructions on machine, Agree to terms and condition (Select "YES", "はい" or "네"), Create PIN number (It is used everytime the card is used) , Enter Username , Select Region (Japanese prefectures or Countries)</li>
</ul>

<h2> Starting </h2>
<p> For DDR machnes after SuperNova 2: When it comes to controlling the screen there are directional arrows and a select button, which is either in the center of the 4 directions or to the right or left of either. (This pertains only to selecting songs and other settings, not for actually playing.) </p>
<br> </br>
<p> However, if you are playing on an ITG cabinet, there are only 2 directional buttons (Left and Right) and a green select and a red escape key. StepManiaX is touch screen, so its just like using a tablet or a phone.</p>
