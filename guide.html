<h2> Finding a location </h2>
<p> If you are like me, and live in the San Francisco Bay Area, there are multiple places to play DDR that have e-amusement support. Some good examples could be Round1 which is a Japanese arcade chain or Dave and Busters. 
    Smaller arcades or GolfLand also have DDR, and other rhythm games.
</p>

<h2> What the hell is e-amusement? </h2>
<p> e-amusement is an online service which allows you to keep scores and stats on the internet. All you need is a small initial payment for the card and that is it. (Round1 carry e-amusement cards, this is where I bought mine) </p>
<h2> How to set up e-amusement</h2>
<ul> 
<li> 1. Purchase e-amusement card from vendor. (Could be from online or from Round1)</li>
<li>2. Go to any e-amusement supported BEMANI game, like DDR, IIDX, DanceRushStardom or Pop'n Music </li>
<li> 3. Scan or insert card in desiginated location on machines with the e-amusement logo. Follow instructions on machine, Agree to terms and condition (Select "YES", "はい" or "네"), Create PIN number (It is used everytime the card is used) , Enter Username , Select Region (Japanese prefectures or Countries)</li>
</ul>
