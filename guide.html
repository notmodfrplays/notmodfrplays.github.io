<h1> Guide To Overall DDR improvements </h1>

<h2> Finding a location </h2>
<p> If you are like me, and live in the San Francisco Bay Area, there are multiple places to play DDR that have e-amusement support. Some good examples could be Round1 which is a Japanese arcade chain or Dave and Busters. 
    Smaller arcades or GolfLand also have DDR, and other music games.

<h2> What the hell is e-amusement? </h2>
<p> e-amusement is an online service which allows you to keep scores and stats on the internet. All you need is a small initial payment for the card and that is it. (Round1 carry e-amusement cards, this is where I bought mine) </p>
